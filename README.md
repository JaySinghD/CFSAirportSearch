**Airport Search for Pilots: FPGA-Based Aerodrome Info System**

Overview
This project implements a real-time airport search tool on the DE1-SoC FPGA platform. It allows pilots to retrieve structured aerodrome data from the Canada Flight Supplement using ICAO codes entered via a PS/2 keyboard. The system displays runway maps and airport services on a VGA monitor and provides audio feedback for user interactions.

Features
- ICAO Code Input:
Users enter 4-letter ICAO codes via PS/2 keyboard to search for Canadian airports.
- Graphical Display:
Runway layouts and airport data are rendered on a VGA screen using pixel-level plotting.
- Audio Feedback:
Success and error tones are generated using waveform synthesis and output via the FPGAâ€™s audio interface.
- Dual-Screen Navigation:
SHIFT key toggles between runway map view and detailed service listings.
- Supported Airports:
CYQM, CYTZ, CYYZ, CYUL, CYFB, CYOO, CYSJ, CYVR


Technical Highlights
- Hardware Platform: DE1-SoC with ARM Cortex-A9 processor
- Languages: C (low-level hardware control)
- Graphics: Custom pixel plotting and character rendering using memory-mapped I/O
- Audio: Waveform generation
- Input Handling: PS/2 scancode parsing with dynamic character rendering
- Data Management: Airport-specific service data stored in structured arrays
